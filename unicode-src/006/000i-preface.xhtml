<p><span class="en"> THE Mahabharatha describes the great war waged in ancient times between the two branches of the one royal family that of the Bharatas. It conserves in a collected form all the ancient beliefs and traditions of the race. ..Bharata is the first attempt at effecting a reconciliation between the culture of the Aryans and the mass of fact and faction, history and mythology which it encountered.. Containing within itself productions of different dates and authorships, the Mahabharatha has became a miscellaneous encyclopaedia of history and mythology, politics, law, theology and Philosophy.</span></p>
